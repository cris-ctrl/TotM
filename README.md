## Description

Welcome to the PC fan-made port of the mobile game: **Tomb of the Mask**. This project is still in early development, so, check in later if you wanna play an smoother version (if i actually finish it ðŸ’€ðŸ’€)lanned for the future. Stay tuned!

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy the nostalgic gameplay of Tomb of the Mask on your PC.
- **Improved Controls**: Experience the game with enhanced controls optimized for PC.

## Installation

For now, there is nothing actually "playble" but if you wanna see how its going, just get the `main.py` file and the `assets` folder, and run the main file. (the main file shoul be in the same directory, besides assets)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!, however, have in mind im still in the process of learing, and this is early dev, so dont expect an very organized code. However, if you wanna help either way, just fork this repo, do your contributions, and do a pull request, I'll see it soon enough :)

## Planned stuff:
for now, i plan im implementing all the same gameplay mechanics, but after that, i plan in rebuilding the levels, and main menu, as closely as my poor artistic skills will allow
